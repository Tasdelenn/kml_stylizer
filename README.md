# KML Merger & Styler

This is a browser-based web application that allows you to upload multiple KML files, customize their styles (line color, width, fill color, and opacity), and merge them into a single downloadable KML file.

All file processing is done entirely on the client-side within your browser. No data or files are ever uploaded to a server, ensuring your privacy.

## Features

*   **Client-Side Processing:** All operations are performed in your browser.
*   **Multiple File Upload:** Upload multiple KML files via drag-and-drop or file selection.
*   **Individual Styling:** Customize the style for each KML file separately:
    *   Line Color
    *   Line Width
    *   Fill Color
    *   Fill Opacity
*   **Merge Files:** Combine your styled KML files into a single document.
*   **Custom Output Name:** Optionally specify a filename for the merged file.
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** A comfortable viewing experience in any lighting.
